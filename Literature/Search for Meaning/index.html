                <h3 id="search-of-meaning">Search of Meaning</h3>
<p>It is just that there is no overarching epistemic meaning to life, universe and existence. No one is epistemically richer, none a life more purposeful.</p>
<p>I find that to have a good life, however, instrumental meaning is necessary. And such is instantiated with fuzzyness, reasonability and the intent of pragmatic action. Reasonability allows for more freedom than rationality as it is commonly understood. It allows for absurdity, beauty and constrained rationality. But with freedom comes perils – the perils of being lost or not seeking, the perils of inaction or oblivion. It is also worth noting the importance of pragmatic action which I believe is interdependent on environment, emperical reality and shared non-deconstructive fiction. I also take liberty in broadening the notion of what it means to be fuzzy from propositional logic and embracing incompleteness of the same.</p>
<p>This is also a right time to juxtapose the concept of Dostoevsky’s Idiot and the Idiot’s awareness of its own limitations. There is much we do not know. So why try to conform and fit everything into a block without respecting abstractions? Why hold on to absolutisms? Aren’t the notions of self and divinity always plural or plurally singular? Why not find beauty through the destruction of the boring in unknowability? Why hate paradoxes? Why not be arrogant and humble?</p>
<p>A lot of daemons arise from self-referencing of the self and subversion of the holistic experience we call life. It is beautiful though that we are aware of such problems and that in the sea of paradoxes and uncomputable abstractive jumps there does lie great pools of comprehensive consistency_._</p>
<p>More daemons arise from debauchery of strength, discipline and happiness. Absurdly, the auspicious one helps for he is the destroyer of all daemons and the benefactor of all sustenance.</p>

<h3 id="trust-and-values">Trust and Values</h3>
<p>Without trust society cannot stand. It is neither truth nor lies that a civilization is built upon. A civilization stands on trust be it fictional, fake or emperical truth. (Huge jump between two sentences). What if we do not experience reality unless we make a fiction out of it? </p>
<p>As to values and personal values, I trust in being virtuous. And my virtuosity assumes openness and honesty in all things important. </p>
