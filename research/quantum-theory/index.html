                <h2 id="on-the-formulations-of-quantum-mechanics">On the Formulations of Quantum Mechanics</h2>
<p>Argument: Quantum Theory <span class="arithmatex">\(=\)</span> Classical Probability Theory with <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span>-norm and continuity axiom (complex numbers).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span>-norm and why not <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>-norm?</p>
<p>Because if there are any linear transformations other than these trivial ones that preserve the <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>-norm, then either <span class="arithmatex">\(p = 1\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(p=2\)</span>. </p>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(p=1\)</span> we get classical probability theory, while if <span class="arithmatex">\(p =2\)</span> we get quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Also all transformations must be norm preserving. So what kind of matrix or linear transformation preserves the <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span>-norm? Unitary Matrices <span class="arithmatex">\((UU^\dagger = I)\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why complex numbers and not real numbers?</p>
<p>Axiom of continuity: There exists a continuous reversible transformation on a system between any two pure states of that system.</p>
<p>Thus, we need our field associated with vector spaces to be algebraically closed. Hence, we need complex numbers.</p>
<p>If you want every unitary operation to have a square root, then you have to go to the complex numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do transformations need to be linear?</p>
<p>If quantum mechanics were nonlinear, then one could build a computer to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. (Abrams and Lloyd).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="history-of-quantum-computing">History of Quantum Computing</h2>
<h3 id="models-of-classical-computation">Models of Classical Computation</h3>
<p>The following serve as universal models of computation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turing Machines</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\lambda\)</span>-calculus</li>
<li>Circuits</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="super-universal">Super-Universal</h3>
<p>Circuits can describe computations which are beyond what a Turing machine can do.</p>
<p>Apparently, we can solve the halting problem under some circuit model. But, what is that supposed to mean?</p>
<h3 id="quantum-computation">Quantum Computation</h3>
<p>The idea of a QC model is to have information in superposition. If we want Turing Machines to be part of the quantum computational model then we will somehow have to make the read/write head to be in a superposition. But that is not possible (doubt). Hence we use a circuit where we keep the bits in a superposition and operate on them with gates.</p>
<h3 id="history-of-quantum-mechanics-and-computation">History of Quantum Mechanics and Computation</h3>
<p>Major questions in QM started arising with the EPR paradox in 1936 when faster than light travel was questioned. </p>
<p>Here's the paradox: Consider <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span> particles that are moving away. Their positions are <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(-x\)</span> and momenta are <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(-p\)</span>. Now we can't measure the exact position and momentum of one particle due to the uncertainty principle. But what if we measure the position of one particle and momentum of the other at the same time (Like a split second difference)? Assuming there is no interaction between the particles, we would in principle know the position and momentum of one particle at a time (cause we can know position or momentum of particle <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> if we measure that quantity on the second particle cause its just the negative of it). This would violate the uncertainty principle. Hence, there has to be some sort of interaction between the two particles that makes the wavefunction of particle <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span> also collapse instantaneously when I measure position or momentum of particle <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>. This mean that the particles were somehow connected. This was the paradox. But Schrodinger said this is possible by entanglement.</p>
<p>In 1964 Bell gave his Theorem and then it was later verified too which proved that Quantum Mechanics is cool with EPR pair. But there was another problem that how is faster than light communication possible? It was later proved that faster than light communication is not possible indeed as you cannot actually send 'information' with the entanglement coordination. Basically you cannot manipulate the particles to actually transmit any useful information.</p>
<p>Non-cloning theorem: In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, a statement which has profound implications in the field of quantum computing among others.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-theory-from-5-reasonable-axioms">Quantum Theory from 5 reasonable Axioms</h2>
<h3 id="state">State</h3>
<p>Mathematical object that can be used to deter-mine the probability associated with the out-comes of any measurement that may be per-formed on a system prepared by the given preparation.</p>
<p>However, we do not need to measure all possible probability measurements to determine the state of a system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>K (degrees of freedom)</strong>: minimum number of probability measurements required to determine the state of a system, i.e., number of real parameters re-quired to specify the state.</li>
<li><strong>N (dimension)</strong>: maximum number of states that can be reliably distinguished from one another in a single shot measurement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="axioms">Axioms</h3>
<ol>
<li>Probabilities</li>
<li>Simplicity: <span class="arithmatex">\(K = K(N)\)</span></li>
<li>Subspaces: If state of a system <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> <span class="arithmatex">\(\in M_{dim}\)</span> subspace <span class="arithmatex">\(\implies dim(A) = M\)</span></li>
<li>Composite systems: <span class="arithmatex">\(N = N_aN_b \text{ and } K = K_aK_b\)</span></li>
<li>Continuity: <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists\)</span> a continuous reversible transformation on a system between anytwo pure states of that system</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="landauers-principle">Landauer's Principle</h2>
<p>Landauer's Principle explains that when info is erased, it requires work.</p>
<p>Each bit erased <span class="arithmatex">\(\implies \Delta S = -K \ln(2)\)</span>. Hence, heat associated is given by <span class="arithmatex">\(Q = -KT \ln(2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence to keep constant temp, that amount of work needs to be put in. This generalises to reversible processes requiring work.</p>
<h2 id="postulates-of-quantum-mechanics">Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</h2>
<p>I shall state here the four major generic postulates of Quantum Mechanics stated in terms of both state-vector formalization and density-matrix formalization.</p>
<h3 id="state-is-a-vector">State is a vector</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isolated physical system is given by its state vector operating on a certain Hilbert space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution of a closed quantum system is given by a unitary transformation.</p>
<p>In its physical interpretation we have this postulate governed by the Schrodinger Equation, as stated.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
i{\hbar}\frac{d\vert\psi\rangle}{dt} = H\vert\psi\rangle
\]</div>
<p>The Hamiltonian is a hermitian operator and has a spectral decomposition, <span class="arithmatex">\(H = \sum E\vert E\rangle\langle E\vert\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component systems.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\vert\psi\rangle = \vert\psi_1\rangle\otimes...\otimes\vert\psi_n\rangle
\]</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantum measurements are described by a collection <span class="arithmatex">\(\{M_m\}\)</span> of measurement operators acting on the state space of the system. </p>
<p>Probability that upon measurement the outcome is <span class="arithmatex">\(m = p(m) = \langle\psi\vert M_m^\dagger M_m\vert\psi\rangle\)</span> and the state of the system becomes as follows.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\vert\psi\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{on measuring}} \frac{M_m\vert\psi\rangle}{\sqrt{p(m)}} = \frac{M_m\vert\psi\rangle}{||M_m\vert\psi\rangle||}
\]</div>
<p>Measurement operators also follow the completeness equation, <span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_m M_m^\dagger M_m = I\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="state-is-a-density-matrix">State is a density matrix</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isolated physical system is given by its density matrix operating on a certain Hilbert space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution of a closed quantum system is given by a unitary transformation as <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho \xrightarrow{U} U\rho U^\dagger\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component systems.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\rho = \rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_n
\]</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantum measurements are described by a collection <span class="arithmatex">\(\{M_m\}\)</span> of measurement operators acting on the state space of the system. </p>
<p>Probability that upon measurement the outcome is <span class="arithmatex">\(m = p(m) = tr(M_m^\dagger M_m\rho)\)</span> and the state of the system becomes as follows.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\rho \xrightarrow{\text{on measuring}} \frac{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}{p(m)}
\]</div>
<p>Measurement operators also follow the completeness equation, <span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_m M_m^\dagger M_m = I\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>
<h3 id="postulate">Postulate</h3>
<p>Quantum Measurements are descrivbed by a collection of  measurement operators <span class="arithmatex">\(\{M_m\}\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(p(m)= \langle \psi | M_m^\dagger M_m | \psi \rangle,\ \sum{p(m)} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\vert \psi \rangle \xrightarrow{\text{on   measurement}} \frac{M_m \vert \psi \rangle}{\sqrt{p(m)}}
\]</div>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(M_i = |i\rangle \langle i|,\ \forall i\)</span>  then we are measuring in a computational basis.</p>
<h3 id="non-distinguishability-of-arbitrary-states">Non-distinguishability of arbitrary states</h3>
<p>We cannot distinguish any two arbitrary non-orthogonal quantum states.</p>
<p>Proof: Let <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi_2\rangle\)</span> be two non-orthogonal states. </p>
<p>Then <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists\ E_1, E_2\)</span> such that <span class="arithmatex">\(E_1 = \sum_{j:f(j) = 1} M_j^\dagger M_j\)</span> and similarly <span class="arithmatex">\(E_2\)</span> then <span class="arithmatex">\(\langle \psi_1 | E_1 | \psi_1 \rangle = 1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\langle \psi_2 | E_2 | \psi_2 \rangle = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, <span class="arithmatex">\(\sqrt{E_2}| \psi_1\rangle = 0\)</span> and let <span class="arithmatex">\(\psi_2 = a\psi_1 + b \phi\)</span> where <span class="arithmatex">\(\psi\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\phi\)</span> are orthogonal.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\langle \psi_2 | E_2 \psi_2 \rangle = |\beta|^2 \langle \psi_2 | \phi \psi_2 \leq  |\beta|^2 &lt; 1
\]</div>
<p>Hence, proved by contradiction.</p>
<h3 id="projective-measurements">Projective Measurements</h3>
<p>We can use projective measurement formalism for any general measurement too.</p>
<p>In case of projective measurements, <span class="arithmatex">\(M = \sum mP_m\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p(m) = \langle \psi | P_m | \psi \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\vert \psi \rangle \rightarrow \frac{P_m \vert \psi\rangle}{\sqrt {p(m)}}
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
E(M) = \sum mp(m) = \langle \psi | M | \psi \rangle = \langle M\rangle
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\Delta(M) = \sqrt{\langle M^2\rangle - \langle M \rangle^2}
\]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="arithmatex">\(E(M)\)</span> is expectation and <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta(M)\)</span> is standard deviation or the square root of variance.</p>
<h3 id="povm-measurements">POVM Measurements</h3>
<p>POVM Measurements are a formalism where only measurement statistics matters.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\{E_m\} \rightarrow \sum{E_m} = I,\ p(m) = \langle \psi | E_m |\psi \rangle
\]</div>
<p>Here, each of <span class="arithmatex">\(E_m\)</span> are hermitian.</p>
<h3 id="global-phase-doesnt-matter">Global Phase doesn't matter</h3>
<p>We say <span class="arithmatex">\(e^{i\theta} |\psi\rangle \equiv |\psi\rangle\)</span> but why? Because, <span class="arithmatex">\(\langle \psi | M_m^{\dagger}M_m | \psi \rangle = \langle \psi \vert e^{-i\theta}M_m^\dagger M_m e^{i\theta}\vert \psi \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, be aware that the global phase is quite different from the relative phase.</p>
<h2 id="density-matrices">Density Matrices</h2>
<p>We can represent a system as an ensemble of pure states <span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_i, \psi_i\}\)</span>. Now, if you have exact knowledge of the system then it is for sure in a pure state, i.e., <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\)</span>. However, if we have classical uncertainty amongst the possible states. The system can be represented as a mixed state <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho = \sum_{i} p_i\psi_i\)</span> where the probabilities <span class="arithmatex">\(p_i\)</span> are classical in nature.</p>
<p>This formulation helps us a lot in dealing with quantum information, noisy systems and helps us represent measurements better, as well. Why? Because it provides a convenient means for describing quantum systems whose state is not completely known.</p>
<h3 id="postulates-in-density-matrices-formulation">Postulates in Density Matrices formulation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isolated physical system is given by its density matrix operating on a certain Hilbert space.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component systems.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\rho = \rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_n
\]</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantum measurements are described by a collection <span class="arithmatex">\(\{M_m\}\)</span> of measurement operators acting on the state space of the system. </p>
<p>Probability that upon measurement the outcome is <span class="arithmatex">\(m = p(m) = tr(M_m^\dagger M_m\rho)\)</span> and the state of the system becomes as follows.</p>

\]</div>
<p>Measurement operators also follow the completeness equation, <span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_m M_m^\dagger M_m = I\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>
<p>Theorem 1: An operator <span class="arithmatex">\(\rho\)</span> is a density operator if and only if it is both positive semi-definite <span class="arithmatex">\((\rho = \rho^\dagger\)</span> and non-negative eigenvalues<span class="arithmatex">\()\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(tr(\rho) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Converse is easy to prove. If an operator is both positive and has trace as one, then it shall have a spectral decomposition of the form <span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_i\lambda_i|i\rangle\langle i|\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the direct proof, let us consider <span class="arithmatex">\(tr(\rho) = \sum_i p_i tr(|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Theorem 2: The sets <span class="arithmatex">\(|\tilde\psi\rangle\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(|\tilde\phi\rangle\)</span> generate the same density matrix if and only if,</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[

<div class="arithmatex">\[
U = \begin{bmatrix}

<div class="arithmatex">\[

<h2 id="chsh-inequality">CHSH Inequality</h2>
<p>In a classical experiment, we have the following setup where Alice can choose to measure either Q or R and Bob chooses either S or T. The measurements are performed imultaneously and far off from each other.</p>
<p><img style="width:80%;" id="image" src="https://file.notion.so/f/f/6ad4622e-38fc-4f69-b458-0d5cc1cce783/609febe9-da3a-4f92-b5a1-d35b81a8be3a/Untitled.png?id=eabce912-0ec4-468f-a11c-03b3e98857ac&table=block&spaceId=6ad4622e-38fc-4f69-b458-0d5cc1cce783&expirationTimestamp=1712239200000&signature=AyNRUZIa6gA_dwtRP1ay0nwB5LKthnuQJEzj-IHgDLQ&downloadName=Untitled.png"></p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
E(QS) + E(RS) + E(RT) - E(QT) = E(QS + RS + RT-QT)
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\implies E(QS) + E(RS) + E(RT) - E(QT) = \sum_{q,r,s,t}p(q, r, s, t)(qs + rs + rt - qt)
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\implies E(QS) + E(RS) + E(RT) - E(QT) \leq \sum_{q,r,s,t}p\times 2 = 2
\]</div>
<p>and thereby we obtain the inequality <span class="arithmatex">\(E(QS) + E(RS) + E(RT) - E(QT) \leq 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is one of the set of Bell inequalities, the first of which was found by John Bell. This one in particular is named CHSH inequality.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-anomaly">Quantum Anomaly</h3>
<p>In the quantum case, let us consider the measurements to be based on the following observables over the EPR pair <span class="arithmatex">\(|\psi\rangle = \frac{|01\rangle - |10\rangle}{\sqrt 2}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
Q = Z_1, R= X_1,
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
S = \frac{-Z_2-X_2}{\sqrt 2},
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
T = \frac{Z_2 - X_2}{\sqrt 2}
\]</div>
<p>Then, we have the following result.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
E(QS) + E(RS) + E(RT) - E(QT) = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} = 2\sqrt 2 &gt; 2
\]</div>
<p>Thus, in other words, CHSH inequality doesn't hold. </p>
<h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3>
<p>The fact that CHSH doesn't hold in the quantum scenario implies that two of the major assumptions about nature is wrong in case of the classical experiment.</p>
<p>The assumptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realism: Q, R, S, T are physical quantities which have defininte values irrespective of observation.</li>
<li>Locality: Alice's measurement doesn't influence that of Bob's.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the result of CHSH being false when accounted for the quantum mechanical properties of nature (we can perform the experiment in a lab with particles) suggests that nature cannot be locally real and neither can any true mathematical representation of it be locally real.</p>
