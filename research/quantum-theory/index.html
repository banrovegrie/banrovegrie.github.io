<p>Argument: Quantum Theory <span class="arithmatex">\(=\)</span> Classical Probability Theory with <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span>-norm and continuity axiom (complex numbers).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span>-norm and why not <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>-norm?</p>
<p>Because if there are any linear transformations other than these trivial ones that preserve the <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span>-norm, then either <span class="arithmatex">\(p = 1\)</span> or <span class="arithmatex">\(p=2\)</span>. </p>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(p=1\)</span> we get classical probability theory, while if <span class="arithmatex">\(p =2\)</span> we get quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Also all transformations must be norm preserving. So what kind of matrix or linear transformation preserves the <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span>-norm? Unitary Matrices <span class="arithmatex">\((UU^\dagger = I)\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why complex numbers and not real numbers?</p>
<p>Axiom of continuity: There exists a continuous reversible transformation on a system between any two pure states of that system.</p>
<p>Thus, we need our field associated with vector spaces to be algebraically closed. Hence, we need complex numbers.</p>
<p>If you want every unitary operation to have a square root, then you have to go to the complex numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do transformations need to be linear?</p>
<p>If quantum mechanics were nonlinear, then one could build a computer to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. (Abrams and Lloyd).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="history-of-quantum-computing">History of Quantum Computing</h2>
<h3 id="models-of-classical-computation">Models of Classical Computation</h3>
<p>The following serve as universal models of computation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turing Machines</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\lambda\)</span>-calculus</li>
<li>Circuits</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="super-universal">Super-Universal</h3>
<p>Circuits can describe computations which are beyond what a Turing machine can do.</p>
<p>Apparently, we can solve the halting problem under some circuit model. But, what is that supposed to mean?</p>
<h3 id="quantum-computation">Quantum Computation</h3>
<p>The idea of a QC model is to have information in superposition. If we want Turing Machines to be part of the quantum computational model then we will somehow have to make the read/write head to be in a superposition. But that is not possible (doubt). Hence we use a circuit where we keep the bits in a superposition and operate on them with gates.</p>
<h3 id="history-of-quantum-mechanics-and-computation">History of Quantum Mechanics and Computation</h3>
<p>Major questions in QM started arising with the EPR paradox in 1936 when faster than light travel was questioned. </p>
<p>Here's the paradox: Consider <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span> particles that are moving away. Their positions are <span class="arithmatex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(-x\)</span> and momenta are <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(-p\)</span>. Now we can't measure the exact position and momentum of one particle due to the uncertainty principle. But what if we measure the position of one particle and momentum of the other at the same time (Like a split second difference)? Assuming there is no interaction between the particles, we would in principle know the position and momentum of one particle at a time (cause we can know position or momentum of particle <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> if we measure that quantity on the second particle cause its just the negative of it). This would violate the uncertainty principle. Hence, there has to be some sort of interaction between the two particles that makes the wavefunction of particle <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span> also collapse instantaneously when I measure position or momentum of particle <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span>. This mean that the particles were somehow connected. This was the paradox. But Schrodinger said this is possible by entanglement.</p>
<p>In 1964 Bell gave his Theorem and then it was later verified too which proved that Quantum Mechanics is cool with EPR pair. But there was another problem that how is faster than light communication possible? It was later proved that faster than light communication is not possible indeed as you cannot actually send 'information' with the entanglement coordination. Basically you cannot manipulate the particles to actually transmit any useful information.</p>
<p>Non-cloning theorem: In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, a statement which has profound implications in the field of quantum computing among others.</p>

<h3 id="state">State</h3>
<p>Mathematical object that can be used to deter-mine the probability associated with the out-comes of any measurement that may be per-formed on a system prepared by the given preparation.</p>
<p>However, we do not need to measure all possible probability measurements to determine the state of a system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>K (degrees of freedom)</strong>: minimum number of probability measurements required to determine the state of a system, i.e., number of real parameters re-quired to specify the state.</li>
<li><strong>N (dimension)</strong>: maximum number of states that can be reliably distinguished from one another in a single shot measurement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="axioms">Axioms</h3>
<ol>
<li>Probabilities</li>
<li>Simplicity: <span class="arithmatex">\(K = K(N)\)</span></li>
<li>Subspaces: If state of a system <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> <span class="arithmatex">\(\in M_{dim}\)</span> subspace <span class="arithmatex">\(\implies dim(A) = M\)</span></li>
<li>Composite systems: <span class="arithmatex">\(N = N_aN_b \text{ and } K = K_aK_b\)</span></li>
<li>Continuity: <span class="arithmatex">\(\exists\)</span> a continuous reversible transformation on a system between anytwo pure states of that system</li>
