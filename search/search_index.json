Cryptography and Physics The philosophical exploration of cryptography from a physical perspective delves into fundamental questions about the nature of information, its robustness under physical laws, and the principles governing its secure communication and control (black hole information paradox, non-locality and nature of quantum information). Need for? Almost always we find works of science established on grounds of mathematical understanding (language formalisation?) and physical importance (pragmatic realism?). However, philosophy (understanding perspective?) is often left out. This often comes around to bite back. The main reason I believe this happens is because of lack of perspective leading to further lack of ideological basis or motivational push. \u2018If\u2019 from Rewards and Fairies If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don\u2019t deal in lies, Or being hated, don\u2019t give way to hating, And yet don\u2019t look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream\u2014and not make dreams your master; If you can think\u2014and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build \u2019em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: \u2018Hold on!\u2019 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings\u2014nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it, And\u2014which is more\u2014you\u2019ll be a Man, my son!

Rosch and Whorf's Hypothesis: an excerpt Rosch's early studies were on color. She learned of the Berlin-Kay color research midway through her own research and found that their results meshed with her own work on Dani, a New Guinea language that has only two basic color categories: mili (dark-cool, including black, green, and blue) and mola (light-warm, including white, red, yellow). Berlin and Kay had shown that focal colors had a special status within color categoraies-that of the best example of the category. Rosch found that Dani speakers, when asked for the best exampies of their two color categories, chose focal colors, for example, white, red, or yellow for mola with different speakers making different choices. In a remarkable set of experiments, Rosch set out to show that primary color categories were psychologically real for speakers of Dani, even though they were not named. She set out to challenge one of Whorf's hypotheses, namely, that language determines one's conceptual system. If Whorf were right on this matter, the Dani's two words for colors would determine two and only two conceptual categories of colors. Rosch reasoned that if it was language alone that determined color categorization, then the Dani should have equal difficulty learning new words for colors, no matter whether the color ranges had a primary color at the center or a nonprimary color. She then went about studying how Dani speakers would learn new, made-up color terms. One group was taught arbitrary names for eight focal colors, and another group, arbitrary names for eight nonfocal colors (Rosch 1973). The names for focal colors were learned more easily. Dani speakers were also found (like English speakers) to be able to remember focal colors better than nonfocal colors (Heider 1972). In an experiment in which speakers judged color similarity, the Dani were shown to represent colors in memory the same way English speakers do (Heider and Olivier 1972).

Or more specifically, wondering about how to think about approaching a problem. Most of these venturing was during my preparation for ICPC (and eventually World Finals). It wasn't all a waste though. Somethings stayed and changed my way of working. Firstly, the differences in approaching problems based on culture (read: particular field) and character (read: seeker or craftspeople). Secondly, the similarities across the board which could be generalized. Cliche, much? Do mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists approach a given problem differently? Is mathematical thinking different from algorithmic thinking? I love the word algorithmic rather than computational because the latter presents an ambiguous scope of considering the purely mechanistic working of a computer. Are there any generalizable heuristics that can be used or applied to any formal problem? In this essay, I will try my best to put forward several ideas I have come across and as they have been filtered and modified by my own point of view. References to interesting reads are present at the end. Mathematical Thinking and Algorithmic Thinking Mathematical thinking and algorithmic thinking have a lot in common. It shall be easier to first define what we consider mathematical thinking to be and what it means to be a mathematician. Mathematical Thinking Mathematical thinking involves the skills of modeling a given problem formally and rigorously arguing about the formal statement. Here, the point of rigor is not to destroy all intuition; instead, it should be used to eliminate bad intuition while clarifying and elevating good intuition. Even though rigor is merely the instrument of demonstration, just as intuition and curiosity are the instruments of invention, there is no denying that it alone can provide us with certainty. Moreover, in mathematics, there are two cultures involved. They differ based on the following two ideologies. The point of understanding mathematics is to become better able to solve problems. The point of solving problems is to understand mathematics better. I subscribe more towards the second culture, probably because I have a greater passion for theory building. It feels quite undeniable to me that there is something truly romantic about extracting underlying structures and generalizing them to create a much bigger, expressive, and beautiful framework. Differences There are two major differences between mathematical and algorithmic thinking. These involve two basic notions inherent to computer science and are totally absent (to a large extent in mathematics). notion of complexity and economy of operation (complexity theories) dynamic notion of the state of any process (data structures) These notions are inherently associated with the idea of implementability, which can be used to put forward the following picture \u2014 is computer science implementable mathematics? And if it were so, then computer science is rooted in physics as much as we believe it is rooted in mathematics. After all, it is the nature of our universe and existence which determines what is implementable and what is not. On Heuristics Proofs are Programs : Often, we find that the approaches we make (both mathematical and psychological) while trying to prove some statement or construct an algorithm are similar. This becomes clearer when we start reading more about the correspondence between proofs, programs, and algebraic structures. Such a trinity allows us to say with certainty that proofs and algorithms are complementary and analogous to a great extent. Furthermore, thinking about proofs and programs in this manner often gives us a clearer perspective while approaching any given problem. Abstraction and Modularity : The set of ideas I hope to entail here also go by several other names, like, wishful thinking and thinking from first principles. However, the main idea is following a modular approach while constructing an algorithm or proving a theorem. You can start off by dividing you problem in layers of chunks and while solving for a specific chunk, consider everything else as a blackbox. You can further hope to simplify each chunk or a set of chunks by reducing it to another problem or wishing off several constraints and trying your hand at that.When dealing with implementation jobs, then this methodology is also referred to as the top-down approach, albeit with some more caveats sprinkled all-over. On a similar note, it is worth remembering that while constructing any mathematical proof, you ought to try stringing lemmas together, along with speculation that has been cleaned and sharpened with rigor. Questions and Perspective : When solving a problem it is vital to keep changing your perspective. You need to look at it and attack it differently (using different tools with different tricks). For example, try contradictions, then maybe induction, then maybe something else and so on. While looking at a problem through different lenses ideally you would want to find the natural world for the problem, express it cohomologically and often the cohomology of that world may solve your problem, like a ripe avocado bursts in your hand. (Grothendieck) Likewise, never hesitate to keep asking questions, no matter how dumb they might seem. Don't take anything you don't really understand for granted! Where's the fun in that? Also, you need to realize how crucial partial progress is. Failures are often crucial advances. In fact, people should write about their failures and speculations while writing a paper. Because well, if we don't at all have any insight into what made someone come up with an argument or construction, then what is the fricking point at all? Formalism and Writing : Formalism is arguably the most important and recurring step towards solving any problem. This is something I learned while studying functional programming. Often, the act of describing a problem and stating it formally reveals what you need to solve it. And in case you are dealing with an algorithm or a computer system, formalism through programming is both the crux and beauty of it. Similarly, on a broader note, writing too is hugely essential. Ideally, it should be the primary mechanism for doing research and not just for reporting it. Conclusion Heuristics, as mentioned above, serve as more of a psychological strategy than a tangible cut out path for solving problems. Almost all major problems that lurk in the horizon of human understanding are mainly solved by experience (of your own field and others), curiosity, hard work and peeking into randomness. Furthermore, we don't really understand how a human being thinks. We do have some understanding that our linguistic capabilities serve as an operating system for our minds supporting abstraction and other cognitive abilities. But, there is so much that we don't understand. However, do not let this lack of understanding reflect any kind of unimportance on the subject - for if we don't even understand how we think, how could we possibly make machines that can truly think like and for us?

Or more specifically, wondering about how to think about approaching a problem. Most of these venturing was during my preparation for ICPC (and eventually World Finals). It wasn't all a waste though. Somethings stayed and changed my way of working. Firstly, the differences in approaching problems based on culture (read: particular field) and character (read: seeker or craftspeople). Secondly, the similarities across the board which could be generalized. Cliche, much? Do mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists approach a given problem differently? Is mathematical thinking different from algorithmic thinking? I love the word algorithmic rather than computational because the latter presents an ambiguous scope of considering the purely mechanistic working of a computer. Are there any generalizable heuristics that can be used or applied to any formal problem? In this essay, I will try my best to put forward several ideas I have come across and as they have been filtered and modified by my own point of view.

Here, the point of rigor is not to destroy all intuition; instead, it should be used to eliminate bad intuition while clarifying and elevating good intuition. Even though rigor is merely the instrument of demonstration, just as intuition and curiosity are the instruments of invention, there is no denying that it alone can provide us with certainty. Moreover, in mathematics, there are two cultures involved. They differ based on the following two ideologies. The point of understanding mathematics is to become better able to solve problems. The point of solving problems is to understand mathematics better. I subscribe more towards the second culture, probably because I have a greater passion for theory building. It feels quite undeniable to me that there is something truly romantic about extracting underlying structures and generalizing them to create a much bigger, expressive, and beautiful framework.","title":"Mathematical Thinking"},{"location":"src/on-problem-solving/#differences","text":"There are two major differences between mathematical and algorithmic thinking. These involve two basic notions inherent to computer science and are totally absent (to a large extent in mathematics). notion of complexity and economy of operation (complexity theories) dynamic notion of the state of any process (data structures) These notions are inherently associated with the idea of implementability, which can be used to put forward the following picture \u2014 is computer science implementable mathematics? And if it were so, then computer science is rooted in physics as much as we believe it is rooted in mathematics. After all, it is the nature of our universe and existence which determines what is implementable and what is not.","title":"Differences"},{"location":"src/on-problem-solving/#on-heuristics","text":"Proofs are Programs : Often, we find that the approaches we make (both mathematical and psychological) while trying to prove some statement or construct an algorithm are similar. This becomes clearer when we start reading more about the correspondence between proofs, programs, and algebraic structures. Such a trinity allows us to say with certainty that proofs and algorithms are complementary and analogous to a great extent. Furthermore, thinking about proofs and programs in this manner often gives us a clearer perspective while approaching any given problem. Abstraction and Modularity : The set of ideas I hope to entail here also go by several other names, like, wishful thinking and thinking from first principles. However, the main idea is following a modular approach while constructing an algorithm or proving a theorem. You can start off by dividing you problem in layers of chunks and while solving for a specific chunk, consider everything else as a blackbox. You can further hope to simplify each chunk or a set of chunks by reducing it to another problem or wishing off several constraints and trying your hand at that.When dealing with implementation jobs, then this methodology is also referred to as the top-down approach, albeit with some more caveats sprinkled all-over. On a similar note, it is worth remembering that while constructing any mathematical proof, you ought to try stringing lemmas together, along with speculation that has been cleaned and sharpened with rigor. Questions and Perspective : When solving a problem it is vital to keep changing your perspective. You need to look at it and attack it differently (using different tools with different tricks). For example, try contradictions, then maybe induction, then maybe something else and so on. While looking at a problem through different lenses ideally you would want to find the natural world for the problem, express it cohomologically and often the cohomology of that world may solve your problem, like a ripe avocado bursts in your hand. (Grothendieck) Likewise, never hesitate to keep asking questions, no matter how dumb they might seem. Don't take anything you don't really understand for granted! Where's the fun in that? Also, you need to realize how crucial partial progress is. Failures are often crucial advances. In fact, people should write about their failures and speculations while writing a paper.
