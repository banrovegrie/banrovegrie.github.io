This reminds me of the line in Bob Dylan's song \"don't criticize what you can't understand\". Dialogue between Bob Tarjan and Don Knuth Well one thing that absolutely blew my mind was Knuth talking about Computer Science from the broad perspective of being a mathematician and scientist. It started with this question posed by Tarjan \u2014 Do you (Knuth) consider yourself as a mathematician, a scientist, an engineer a philosopher or an artist? Knuth gave a very fine answer. He said that he believes science is that which is so well understood by us humans that we can code it up into a computer. However, very often we find our mind meanders around and stays a few jumps ahead which ultimately depicts itself as art. He also exclaimed how mathematics and computer science are the only domains that exist in the realm on science yet are not directly based of nature and rather belong to worlds designed artificially by us (plug-in computational thinking vs mathematical thinking). On what engineering means Zeeshan mentioned the meaning of the word \"engineering\" means \"cleverness\". Universe is a search problem? Purpose of the universe: is the universe just another parallel process in some kind of interacting parallel processes working on a search problem? Measure shouldn't be a target Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes. In other words, \"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\" Isn't it exactly what happened in MDL Project? Similarly, happiness shouldn\u2019t be a target. Rather it can be a reasonable measure but not the major one. Don\u2019t chase happiness. Become interesting and antifragile. On recent non-fiction books I love I fucking love Scott Aaronson's book. Quantum Computing since Democritus falls in my Birth of a Theorem category. I absolutely love them. Feynman's two autobiographical books, especially \"What do you care what other people think\" is a amazing motivator. I guess I will talk about old reads which changed my perspective, sometime later. A little off-topic but Lex Fridman's podcast has severely affected my life \u2014 in a very good way. Richard Borcherds interview Try counter-examples and try proving at the same time, for sure either one will work out. Mathematics is discovered. How? If there were another civilization that we come across, we shall share the same mathematical ideas \u2014 even though representations and formalisms might be different. Now my question is that \u2014 does it mean humans can serve to be \"universal conscious machine\" because they can do math? \"There are some mathematicians whose work I could have never discovered for myself \u2014 no matter how harder or smarter I worked \u2014 Grothendieck is one of them.\" On technology I want to be a Computer Scientist and an Engineer \u2014 not just because of my interest but also because I want to fight evil regimes and technology (not just mere ideas) is the greatest weapon against authoritarianism. On fiction and literature Good literature helps you build your soul. Literature drives us through the ideas and problems a person is facing by standing on his or her foorsteps and thinking about choices and their effects \u2014 choices that you or I may never face directly but does help in thinking clearly about a ton of other choices that we shall come across in life. Denis Nardin on how to do math research I liked how he mentioned the same methodology for learning something as Siddharth had suggested me. Be a cow, eat the main ideas, come back chew on them and maybe come back again and chew on other stuff (... till you understand). They also talked about how important active listening and asking stupid question are. Also, while reading a paper do not have the target of completing proper reading of it, rather look for and understand what you are interested in. Circles of responsibility Before we discuss the circles of responsibility, let\u2019s look into possibly what makes us human. It sure would have to do with our agency and desire to set forth creation in motion. What about the pursuit of understanding and purpose?\u200c That sure seems important too and probably has a direct connection to the notion of evolution in the form that you gain more knowledge and insight about the world so as to adapt better. Also, note that here purpose means more like arth (in sanskrit). This also begs forth the question regarding the nature of consciousness and agency - on whether there exists universality of the same and whether they are simulation emergent and platform independent. Would be kinda satisfying to have the existence of some form of divinity permeading existence. Something you can not only sample but also transform. Note that defining what makes us human is a very hard and often fruitless endeavour. Maybe the above was as well. Ok so the circles. The claim is that you have more moral responsibility towards your family, then friends, then country and eventually humanity and so on, in a strictly decreasing order. Superman\u2019s superpower Confidence (origin: confidere , meaning: have full trust ) is based on intense trust on yourself, your abilities and your potential and maybe bring out the same from others. When you are really confident you learn to let go of the insatiable need to control things. Stop overanalysing, start believing. \u201cThe more you try, the further away you are.\u201d - The Backwards Law For example, the more you try to float, the more you sink. In dating, the more you chase after someone, the more repulsed that person gets since they sense neediness. In business or poker, the stress of thinking of not having or losing money puts you in that poverty mindset of scarcity. Thinking in bets When making decisions think in percentages rather than black or white. You need to get comfortable with incomplete information. making high quality decisions are definitely profitable only in the long run increase accuracy of our beliefs and decisions calculate expected value think about opportunity costs Propaganda Edward Bernays, often regarded as the father of modern public relations, explored the relationship between democracy and propaganda. He believed that in democratic societies, propaganda could be used to shape public opinion and influence behavior, effectively molding consent. Bernays emphasized the power of persuasion through targeted messaging and the manipulation of emotions, habits and opinions; suggesting that propaganda played a significant role in maintaining social order and managing public opinion. Berney saw democracy not as a society where people govern themselves through a defusion of power but as a society that could be managed by few individual hands (invisible governors). He believed most people were just too dumb or prone to violence to think for themselves except in the narrow confines of an election with extremely sparse options (say just two candidates like presidential election in the US). \u201cRest of the time people needed to be policed and nudged from the top down for life to remain decent\u201d. Skincare Cleanser with Salicylic Acid Cleanser with Benzoyl Perxoide Gel with Benzoyl Peroxide Serum with Retinol AM/PM Moisturizer Gotta get more info on this from Srinidhi. One cool thing was that mom mentioned was coffee and umm I think it was besan? Don\u2019t give a fuck I have been reading up on Lisa Barrett\u2019s research and how our brain doesn\u2019t detect reality; it creates it. We often wonder how propaganda, social norms, \"why smile is happy and frown is bad\", sexual biases, likeness work without emphasising how important our thought-process and perception work in dealing with input information. Now there is something cool that I can draw parallel to with how GPT3 works say. It is better at criticising, realising it's mistakes and produce desirable outcomes when it is aware that it is thinking. Our brains also kinda feel similar in that sense. When we realise how we are actively performing \"reverse inference\" or plain-old \"thinking\", we seem to be less prone to propaganda, biases etc or at least know that we are prejudiced. That also seems to be the core philosophy of CBT which I think is the only proper treatment to any psychological issue or disease. Your are not your thoughts. They are just results of pseudorandom generation. And learn to not give a fuck. Chimpanzee Politics Chimpanzee Politics: This book started the notion of \"alpha-male\". It's not at all what we consider the word to mean today. I think this difference in meaning is associated with machiavellian people. Regarding machiavellianism and the dark triad (this, narcissism and psychopathy) it is worth noting that these people are more attracted to power, have more shallow mass appraisal abilities and are in fact more often found in positions of power. In recent times, I think these people find ways to morph notions of \"alpha-male\" and \"stoicism\" to make it sound like the norm and evolution and what \"general people\" are supposed to be. Notes from a conversation with Kannan Kannan mentioned something dope about the deva and asura state of mind. He went on to that the deva state of mind is a metaphor for your desire to work for work\u2019s sake and the asura state of mind as a metaphor for your desire to work for something else\u2019s sake. Both are necessary to churn the ocean of existence and bring up the nectar of accomplishment or result. However, how much you get to taste it depends on the amount of your deva state of mind. Revelations on career interests after talking to Zeeshan There is a certain intersection of things I am truly interested in. It is the intersection of machine learning, quantum physics and computational complexity. Definite interest, prospective of wealth, and possibility of great work are the main motivational markers behind any endeavour I take on. And for me to have definite interest is essentially interest coupled with aptitude. Quality > Quantity (something I tend to forget). Diplomacy and Perception Identities matter to us more than actions. By turning actions into identities we can make people much more likely to engage in those desired actions. Speak with a great deal of confidence. Remove fillers. Be prophetic. Don\u2019t ask me wtf that means. Discipline Discipline is self-acquired, motivation is divine and inspirations are people. And together they build strength. To attain discipline and change habits, it is worthy to note that indentity changes often seem to work best. It is specifically because identity changes behaviour which in turn is the way to change thoughts, feelings and perception. \u201cNever think there\u2019s anything in this world you are not good enough for\u201d. Belief is indeed an extraordinary superpower. There lies rationality in the irrationality of it. Society stands because of it. But in its core it is just about letting go of dwelling in doubts and becoming stronger. Faith What fear do you have that shiva cannot destroy? Why wonder over which you have no control ever? Is it the horrid the wave incoming? Is it the fear of being submerged? Is that making you weak and wonder, in haste, as if your subconscious is looking up to you and pestering you for help? Well fuck that, take your surf board out, ride the damn wave. Get out of the prison you have built for yourself. Go out, yea literally. Feel the free breeze kiss your cheeks in the name of freedom. Let them chains break. May only the kara of discipline stay on to defend the demons. Stop dwelling in fictions of reality. Live in the world. The world as it is right now. For this world is yours. Remember who you are. Raise yourself from the sharab of gloom, maya and crowd. Rise!\u200c Work! Fight! And you shall have god and men behind you. On Elon Musk Elon is extremely charismatic, even though he might not be the best of orators, almost in a prophetic way. He has a formidable intellect. He knows shit. He is an extremely dedicated risk-taker. He is probably one of the most driven person alive. I truly admire his courage and optimism, a primary takeaway for me. Elon Musk isn\u2019t self made : It undermines to say that he isn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t deserve being a co-founder of Tesla : Without him the company wouldn\u2019t even been able to make a dent. Always always a rich brat : Was bankrupt atleast once. Does that mean he never bullshits outright? Fuck no. He makes up stories and holds strong stale (too much like Errol?) opinions. His lack of understanding empathy is utterly debilitating. More than enough to undo everything he strives for maybe. \u201cIt can be hard to remove the dark strands without unravelling the entire cloth\u201d - Walter Isaacson. Reckless, callous, reactive, egoistic (doesn\u2019t take no-s), lacks patience and an exceeding asshole with managing or dealing with people (while not giving credit where credit\u2019s due). Elon truly believes that what he is doing will revolutionise daily human lives for ever. Has Tesla helped in fixing global warming? Probably not. Will it, some day? Probably. Are Hyperloop and x.com gonna be successful? Mostly no. Is he trustworthy? Is he good? I do not know. Ab initio cum recta abstractio It is important to think from the ground up but you must be at the right ground. Hence, ab initio cum recta abstractio . From the beginning with the correct abstraction. Great speeches and people \u201cFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\u201d, Abraham Lincoln at the Gettysberg Adderess 1863, \u201c... and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\u201d \"In a free enterprise, the community is not just another stakeholder in business, but, is in fact, the very purpose of its existence.\u201d, Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata. Code Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express. A nice mantra to remember when you think of approaching any system design job be it in the manufacturing industry or be it in good old software engineering. Now, on the subject of actual \u201ccode\u201d or \u201cprograms or software\u201d, code is used and read more than it is written. Zeeshan sent me a blog post regarding this. biz > user > ops > maintainer > author Good Ideas and Comedy They are related. Both are based on noticing anomalies (often quite randomly). Much of standup comedy is based on anomalies in daily life. Whereas good ideas to work originate from anomalies at the frontier of knowledge. I think there was Paul Graham blog on the same. Democracy in Business Always selling and marketing based on the whims of the public is a fast track to disaster for the public and often for the institution doing it too. However, certain individuals can get wealth and influence, a lot of it, by doing this. This begs the question whether democracy, the way we know it, is scheduled for an upgrade? But replacing it takes away the power from the public. Not good. Not good at all. So you gotta have a system where people have individual power but you can always work towards making them more educated and informed and introduce products that let them know what they really want and is good for them. But in the end, they gotta make the decision. You can not take that power away from the public. It is not about what the audience wants. Its about what you love, what the world needs and what the world wants. In that order. Why not not start a startup This is straight from Paul Graham\u2019s blog on the same exact topic. I will try to summarise and mention it out here (especially/only shit that are applicable to me). Being too young or inexperienced : He goes on to argue and gives examples and blah blah. Although, he still thinks that \u201c23 is a better age than 21. But the best way to get experience if you're 21 is to start a startup.\u201d Not determined enough : This is rather interesting; especially since one would think that determination is major driver. Well it still is just that you don\u2019t have to be determined about the business as long as you are determined enough to carry it out as a personal project of sorts. Know nothing about business : Should be a no brainer cause you can always learn this shit. No idea :\u200c Huh?! Wtf?! Well better just read directly out of Graham\u2019s blog for better capture. \u201cIn a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because most startups change their idea anyway. In the average Y Combinator startup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the first three months. Sometimes it's 100%. In fact, we're so sure the founders are more important than the initial idea that we're going to let people apply with no idea at all...\u201d","title":"Journal"},{"location":"Random/Private%20Journal/#journal","text":"","title":"Journal"},{"location":"Random/Private%20Journal/#dont-criticize-what-you-cant-understand","text":"Don't write what you do not \u2014 to at least a certain admissible level \u2014 understand.

It sure would have to do with our agency and desire to set forth creation in motion.

Also, note that here purpose means more like arth (in sanskrit). This also begs forth the question regarding the nature of consciousness and agency - on whether there exists universality of the same and whether they are simulation emergent and platform independent. Would be kinda satisfying to have the existence of some form of divinity permeading existence. Something you can not only sample but also transform. Note that defining what makes us human is a very hard and often fruitless endeavour. Maybe the above was as well. Ok so the circles.

He believed that in democratic societies, propaganda could be used to shape public opinion and influence behavior, effectively molding consent. Bernays emphasized the power of persuasion through targeted messaging and the manipulation of emotions, habits and opinions; suggesting that propaganda played a significant role in maintaining social order and managing public opinion. Berney saw democracy not as a society where people govern themselves through a defusion of power but as a society that could be managed by few individual hands (invisible governors). He believed most people were just too dumb or prone to violence to think for themselves except in the narrow confines of an election with extremely sparse options (say just two candidates like presidential election in the US). \u201cRest of the time people needed to be policed and nudged from the top down for life to remain decent\u201d.","title":"Propaganda"},{"location":"Random/Private%20Journal/#skincare","text":"Cleanser with Salicylic Acid Cleanser with Benzoyl Perxoide Gel with Benzoyl Peroxide Serum with Retinol AM/PM Moisturizer Gotta get more info on this from Srinidhi.

It is better at criticising, realising it's mistakes and produce desirable outcomes when it is aware that it is thinking. Our brains also kinda feel similar in that sense. When we realise how we are actively performing \"reverse inference\" or plain-old \"thinking\", we seem to be less prone to propaganda, biases etc or at least know that we are prejudiced.
