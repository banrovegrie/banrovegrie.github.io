But to bleed you must pick the sword up and fight. A lot. The desire preceeds the need.

The composed art lies within, to be revealed once you wash the red away and only the deep stains which must remain, remain. With the revelation, also immerses away your burden of ownership. As it should. The art is of all, for all yet by all but you.

This reminds me of the line in Bob Dylan's song \"don't criticize what you can't understand\". Ab initio cum recta abstractio It is important to think from the ground up but you must be at the right ground. Hence, ab initio cum recta abstractio . From the beginning with the correct abstraction. Cryptography and Physics The philosophical exploration of cryptography from a physical perspective delves into fundamental questions about the nature of information, its robustness under physical laws, and the principles governing its secure communication and control (black hole information paradox, non-locality and nature of quantum information). Need for? Almost always we find works of science established on grounds of mathematical understanding (language formalisation?) and physical importance (pragmatic realism?). However, philosophy (understanding perspective?) is often left out. This often comes around to bite back. The main reason I believe this happens is because of lack of perspective leading to further lack of ideological basis or motivational push. \u2018If\u2019 from Rewards and Fairies If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don\u2019t deal in lies, Or being hated, don\u2019t give way to hating, And yet don\u2019t look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream\u2014and not make dreams your master; If you can think\u2014and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build \u2019em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: \u2018Hold on!\u2019 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings\u2014nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it, And\u2014which is more\u2014you\u2019ll be a Man, my son! The poem nicely encapsulates my notion of virtue ethics. To be stable when none are, to be trustworthy when none are, to be hated but not giveaway to hating, to not be too proud or be grandoise, to be stoic about results yet be passionate about actions, to build things back up no matter how many times they are broken, to wager away everything on that what you feel righteous and to hold on to all these when despair glooms all. The only line which feels ill to me is \u201cIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much\u201c. Might it rather be: If neither foes nor loving friends can make you, Feel that life\u2019s worth is futile much; Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it, And\u2014which is more\u2014you\u2019ll be a great, my son! \u2018Gettysberg Address\u2019 by Abraham Lincoln Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate \u2014 we can not consecrate \u2014 we can not hallow \u2014 this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us\u2014that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion \u2014 that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain \u2014 that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom \u2014 and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. Diplomacy and Perception Identities matter to us more than actions. By turning actions into identities we can make people much more likely to engage in those desired actions. Speak with a great deal of confidence. Remove fillers. Be prophetic. Don\u2019t ask me wtf that means. Code Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express. A nice mantra to remember when you think of approaching any system design job be it in the manufacturing industry or be it in good old software engineering. Now, on the subject of actual \u201ccode\u201d or \u201cprograms or software\u201d, code is used and read more than it is written.

However, certain individuals can get wealth and influence, a lot of it, by doing this. Trust and Values Without trust society cannot stand. It is neither just truth nor lies that a civilization is built upon. A civilization stands on trust be it fictional, fake or emperical truth.
