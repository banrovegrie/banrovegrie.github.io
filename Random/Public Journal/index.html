<h3 id="cryptography-and-physics">Cryptography and Physics</h3>
<p>The philosophical exploration of cryptography from a physical perspective delves into fundamental questions about the nature of information, its robustness under physical laws, and the principles governing its secure communication and control (black hole information paradox, non-locality and nature of quantum information).</p>
<h3 id="need-for">Need for?</h3>
<p>Almost always we find works of science established on grounds of mathematical understanding (language formalisation?) and physical importance (pragmatic realism?). However, philosophy (understanding perspective?) is often left out. This often comes around to bite back. The main reason I believe this happens is because of lack of perspective leading to further lack of ideological basis or motivational push.</p>
<h3 id="if-from-rewards-and-fairies">‘If’ from Rewards and Fairies</h3>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br />
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: </p>
<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br />
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br />
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: </p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ </p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
<p>The poem nicely encapsulates my notion of virtue ethics. To be stable when none are, to be trustworthy when none are, to be hated but not giveaway to hating, to not be too proud or be grandoise, to be stoic about results yet be passionate about actions, to build things back up no matter how many times they are broken, to wager away everything on that what you feel righteous and to hold on to all these when despair glooms all.</p>
<p>The only line which feels ill to me is “If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much“. Might it rather be:</p>
<p>If neither foes nor loving friends can make you,<br />
Feel that life’s worth is futile much;<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
And—which is more—you’ll be a great, my son!</p>
<h3 id="gettysberg-address-by-abraham-lincoln">‘Gettysberg Address’ by Abraham Lincoln</h3>
<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
